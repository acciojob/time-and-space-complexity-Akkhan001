	<h1>Time, Space, Complexity</h1>

    <p>



        Many times there are more than one ways to solve a problem with different algorithms and we need a way to compare
        multiple ways. Also, there are situations where we would like to know how much time and resources an algorithm might
        take when implemented. To measure performance of algorithms, we typically use time and space complexity analysis.
        The idea is to measure order of growths in terms of input size.
    
        Independent of the machine and its configuration, on which the algorithm is running on.
        Shows a direct correlation with the number of inputs.
        Can distinguish two algorithms clearly without ambiguity.
        Time Complexity: The time complexity of an algorithm quantifies the amount of time taken by an algorithm to run as a
        function of the length of the input. Note that the time to run is a function of the length of the input and not the
        actual execution time of the machine on which the algorithm is running on.
    
        The valid algorithm takes a finite amount of time for execution. The time required by the algorithm to solve given
        problem is called time complexity of the algorithm. Time complexity is very useful measure in algorithm analysis.
    
        It is the time needed for the completion of an algorithm. To estimate the time complexity, we need to consider the
        cost of each fundamental instruction and the number of times the instruction is executed.

   <p><b>Space Complexity</b> is the total space taken by an algorithm with respect to the input size. For instance, if an algorithm uses an array of size n, it will require O(n) space.</p>
