<H1>Time, Space, Complexity</H1>
<p>



    Many times there are more than one ways to solve a problem with different algorithms and we need a way to compare
    multiple ways. Also, there are situations where we would like to know how much time and resources an algorithm might
    take when implemented. To measure performance of algorithms, we typically use time and space complexity analysis.
    The idea is to measure order of growths in terms of input size.

    Independent of the machine and its configuration, on which the algorithm is running on.
    Shows a direct correlation with the number of inputs.
    Can distinguish two algorithms clearly without ambiguity.
    Time Complexity: The time complexity of an algorithm quantifies the amount of time taken by an algorithm to run as a
    function of the length of the input. Note that the time to run is a function of the length of the input and not the
    actual execution time of the machine on which the algorithm is running on.

    The valid algorithm takes a finite amount of time for execution. The time required by the algorithm to solve given
    problem is called time complexity of the algorithm. Time complexity is very useful measure in algorithm analysis.

    It is the time needed for the completion of an algorithm. To estimate the time complexity, we need to consider the
    cost of each fundamental instruction and the number of times the instruction is executed.

    <b>
        Space Complexity
    </b>
    The term Space Complexity is misused for Auxiliary Space at many places. Following are the correct definitions of
    Auxiliary <b>Space and Complexity</b>

    Auxiliary Space is the extra space or temporary space used by an algorithm.

    The <b>space Complexity </b> of an algorithm is the total space taken by the algorithm with respect to the input size.<b> Space
    complexity </b>includes both Auxiliary space and space used by input.

    For example, if we want to compare standard sorting algorithms on the basis of space, then Auxiliary Space would be
    a better criterion than <b> Space Complexity</b> Merge Sort uses O(n) auxiliary space, Insertion sort, and Heap Sort use
    O(1) auxiliary space. The <b>space complexity</b> of all these sorting algorithms is O(n) though.

    <b>Space complexity </b> is a parallel concept to time complexity. If we need to create an array of size n, this will
    require O(n) space. If we create a two-dimensional array of size n*n, this will require O(n2) space.

    In recursive calls stack space also counts.
