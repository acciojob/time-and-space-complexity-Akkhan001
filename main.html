	<h1>Time, Space, Complexity</h1>
<p>
Time complexity is an efficient way to measure the performance of an algorithm. It quantifies the amount of time taken by an algorithm to run as a function of the length of the input. It's independent of the machine and its configuration on which the algorithm is running. It shows a direct correlation with the number of inputs and can distinguish two algorithms clearly without ambiguity. The valid algorithm takes a finite amount of time for execution. To estimate the time complexity, we need to consider the cost of each fundamental instruction and the number of times the instruction is executed.

   <p><b>Space Complexity</b> is the total space taken by an algorithm with respect to the input size. For instance, if an algorithm uses an array of size n, it will require O(n) space.</p>
